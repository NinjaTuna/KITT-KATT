\subsection{Report 1}
In order to obtain a spatial resolution of \SI{1}{\centi\meter} the frequency of the audio signal should have a wavelength of at most \SI{1}{\centi\meter}. This means that $f=\frac{v_\text{sound,air}}{\lambda_{signal}}\geq\frac{340}{0.01}=\SI{34}{\kilo\hertz}$, assuming the speed of sound in air can be approximated by \SI{340}{\meter\per\second}. To satisfy the Nyquist criterion, the microphones must sample at twice this frequency to avoid aliasing. This seems a bit high and might lead to problems both in storage of samples (5 channels) and processing power. Therefore, sampling at \SI{44.1}{\kilo\hertz} seems more realistic. The highes frequency that can be detected accurately is then \SI{22.05}{\kilo\hertz}, corresponding to \SI{1.54}{\centi\meter}; this seems reasonable. The maximal propagation delay corresponding to \SI{5}{\meter} is $t_{\text{5m}}=\frac{5}{340}=\SI{147}{\milli\second}$. This corresponds to \num{649} samples at \SI{44.1}{\kilo\hertz}.

A typical channel impulse response is shown in figure \ref{fig:ass2_typical} from which we can see that a typical impulse response takes about \SI{10}{\milli\second} before it is no longer distinguishable from noise. Therefore, we chose \texttt{timer3} to be \SI{8}{\hertz} so that the repetition period is \SI{0.125}{\milli\second}.
