\chapter{Contactless Charging}
In this chapter it will be briefly described how a contactless charging system was designed and built. The main idea to achieve this was by transmitting energy through space by using magnetic fields. In this system one coil is a transmitter of magnetic energy and the second coil a receiver. For this a fluctuating magnetic field had to be created. Nevertheless, both the energy source and the capacitor bank of the car use direct current. This problems thus translates into designing a DC/DC converter. Furthermore, this problem can be dissected in designing a DC/AC-inverter, a transformer and a AC/DC-rectifier. This charging system can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:contactless-charging}.

The DC/AC-inverter was made by making use of power electronics. This DC/AC-inverter converts a DC signal into a square wave signal. This signal had to be in solid resonance, for this we used a frequency of \SI{100}{kHz}. For optimal charging speed we used a duty cycle of \SI{40}{\percent}. After this signal is transmitted to the secondary coil it is then converted to a DC signal by using diodes. The parameters of the coils are displayed in Table~\ref{tab:charging-coil-params-calc}.

\begin{table}[H]

	\caption{Calculated coil parameters}
	\label{tab:charging-coil-params-calc}
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
		\hline\hline
		Coil & Windings & Inductance & Outer diameter & Total wire length \\
		\hline
		Primary & \num{30} & \SI{101.6}{\micro H} & \SI{188}{mm} & \SI{11.2}{m} \\
		Secondary & \num{15} & \SI{22}{\micro H} & \SI{119}{mm} & \SI{4}{m} \\
		\hline
		\end{tabular}
\end{table} 

This system gave us a maximum charging speed of 3:45 minutes and met all the requirements.
