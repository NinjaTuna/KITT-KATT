\section*{Abstract}
Electric transport will be of great influence in the way we transport in 20 years. In this report, we will try to come up with solutions for the technical problems that come with transporting electrically. These technical problems include charging wirelessly, localization using time difference of arrival information of an estimated five-channel microphone setup, controlling a car to a given location, designing an interface to interact with the whole system and full system testing. Our design choices are based on results of thorough mathematical analyses and simulation and measurement results. We were eventually able to design a system which charges an electric radio-controlled car wirelessly and then autonomously drives it to a given location. This system consists mainly of software written in the C\# and \texttt{MATLAB} language.
