\section*{Abstract}
The subject of the EPO-4 project already becomes clear from the name, "Electric Transport 2020". This project focusses namely on the electric charging and autonomous driving aspect of future electric cars. \\
 It's of great relevance to investigate and optimize the charging systems of electric cars for our future. As more electric cars might subtitute cars using natural resources like oil. For the EPO-4 project a contactless charging system was designed and build. In this document it will be broadly described how this was achieved. For more thorough information on the charging system consult our earlier deliverable reports. \\
 Autonomous driving will completely change the way we tranport. There are some advantages that are worthwhile mentioning. As for example autonomous driving systems could mean fewer tranfic collisions, in responce to the latter advantange speed limits could be raised and increased roadway capacity. As for this project we limited ourselves to localizing the car and letting it drive autonomously in a 2D plane while avoiding obstacles. How this was achieved will be elaborated in this document. Likewise one can find more information on this topic in the deliverable reports.
