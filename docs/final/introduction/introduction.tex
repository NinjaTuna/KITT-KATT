\chapter{Introduction}
The subject of the EPO-4 project already becomes clear from its name \textit{Electric Transport 2020}. This project focuses on the electric charging and autonomous driving aspect of future electric cars. It's of great relevance to investigate and optimize the charging systems of electric cars for our future, as more electric cars might substitute cars using natural resources like oil. Autonomous driving could completely change our way of transportation. There are some advantages that are worth mentioning. For example, autonomous driving systems could potentially mean fewer traffic collisions. As a consequence of the latter advantage, speed limits could be raised and roadway capacity could be increased, leading to more efficient transportation of people and goods.

The goal of the EPO-4 project is to design a system which is able to wirelessly charge and then autonomously control a car, named KITT, to a certain location. An overview of the system we designed to fulfil this task, will be given in Chapter~\ref{ch:system-overview}. We will then perform a more in-depth analysis of each individual module, starting with Chapter~\ref{ch:charging}, which briefly describes the wireless charging process. Chapter~\ref{ch:localization} describes the way we localize KITT before being able to control it. Then, Chapter~\ref{ch:control} describes the controller which will be responsible for driving to the given location, using the location data provided by the localization module. Then, we need a system that provides the user with some additional controls, as well as visualization, along with a method to actually control KITT wirelessly via Bluetooth. Chapter~\ref{ch:gui-communication} examines the way we implemented these features in a C\# program. Finally, to make up for the very small amount of testing time, we designed an extensive subsystem to simulate KITT and the various other modules as needed, which will be discussed in Chapter~\ref{ch:simulation}. We shall then conclude this report in Chapter~\ref{ch:final-thoughts} with a small recap of our findings through the report, as well as any improvements that could be implemented in the future.
