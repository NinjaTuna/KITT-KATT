\chapter{Introduction}
In EPO-4 a smart electric car called KITT had to be made able to charge wirelessly and drive through a plane while avoiding obstacles. \\
To charge it wirelessly two coils where used. One connected to the soure and one connected to KITT. The main task was to charge KITT's super capacitor bank as quick as possible. \\
To drive KITT via a PC firstly Bluetooth communication has to be established. To localize KITT sound signals sent by a beacon on KITT. This signals where detected on five microphones and analyzed by the PC. Eventually this information is used to determine the speed and the steering of the car. The car can drive using PWM motors controlled via the Bluetooth connection. Furthermore, KITT was equiped with two acoustic sensors. This sensors where used to determine where obstacles where placed. \\ \\ 

In Chapter~\ref{ch:charging} it will be explained how contacless charging was achieved and how it is optimized. Eventually the results of the build charging system are shown. 
Driving KITT through plane while avoiding obstacles can be seen as one big complex system. The complixity of this system can be reduced by dividing it in sub-components. How this entire system in divided in multiple sub-components is shown in Chapter~\ref{ch:control}. In the remaining chapters each sub-component it will be explained how each sub-component was made.
