\section*{Abstract}
This document describes the work of EPO-4 project group B2 halfway through the stage of designing and implementing a fully autonomous, Bluetooth controlled vehicle. The focus is on system integration much more than specific design considerations; the latter has already been discussed at length in earlier deliverable reports. Combining key parts of what powers the car, drives the car and ``thinks'' for the car are addressed in this paper. Details on the choice of charging mechanism, anti-collision detection and control system are presented whilst leaving the technical details to the associated deliverables and appendices. In conclusion, the charging system works as expected whilst ideas to improve the Bluetooth communication by a factor of 10-30 are implemented. The control system is finalized with a C\# implementation and the system is tied together meeting almost all specifications with a neat gui.
