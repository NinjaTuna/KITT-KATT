\section*{Abstract}
This document describes the work of EPO-4 project group B2 halfway through the stage of designing and implementing a fully autonomous, Bluetooth controlled vehicle. The focus is on system integration much more than specific design considerations; the latter has already been discussed at length in earlier deliverable reports. Combining key parts of what powers the car, drives the car and ``thinks'' for the car are addressed in this paper. Details are given on the choice of charging mechanism, anti-collision detection and control system are presented whilst leaving the technical details to the associated deliverables. 
HIER MOET NOG DE CONCLUSIE KOMEN
