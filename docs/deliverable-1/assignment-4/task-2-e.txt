The steady-state power consumption to maintain a certain velocity is dependend on a lot of factors. These factors include the resistances which the car is subject to and the characteristics of the motor and the battery. Therefore, if one was to correctly simulate the steady-state power consumption of the car at certain velocities, the modelling of the forces would be likely correct. Similarly, if one was also to correctly simulate the acceleration of the car, the dynamic model used would be very likely viable. The mismatch of the model and the measured values would indicate the accuracy of the dynamic model. Note that the model is heavily dependend on its parameters. For that reason, misguessing these parameters would result greater mismatch of the simulation than necessary.
