\section{Using the Doppler effect to 	increase measurement accuracy}
Let us consider KITT driving with velocity $v'$ at a non-moving object at distance $x$. One can use the classical Doppler effect to accurately determine the distance to this non-moving object. The wavelength $\lambda'$ of the wave, which will be sent out by KITT's ultrasonic sensor, is given by

\begin{equation}
	\lambda' = \lambda - \Delta \lambda = T (v - v'),
\end{equation}

in which the speed of sound is given by $v$ and the period at which the waves are sent out by $T$. The sent-out waves will reflect at the non-moving object and will consequently be sensed by KITT's sensors. Their wavelength will then be given by

\begin{equation}
	\lambda'' = \lambda' - \Delta \lambda = T (v - 2 v').
\end{equation}

The period $T'$ of the incoming waves is thus

\begin{equation}
	T' = \frac{\lambda''}{v} = T \frac{v - 2 v'}{v}.
\end{equation}

One can use the ratio of the periods of transmitted and received waves to determines the vehicle's speed.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ass-2-vel-car}
 	v' = \left(1-\frac{T'}{T} \right) \frac{v}{2}
 \end{equation}

Between the transmission and reception of the waves, a time $T_s$ will have elapsed and the vehicle will have moved a distance $v' T_s$. Thus, the total distance a wave will have travelled is given by

\begin{equation}
	x_{wave} = 2 d - T_s v' = T_s v.
\end{equation}

Solving for $x$ yields

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ass-2-pre-dist-car}
	x = \frac{v T_s}{4} \left(3 - \frac{T'}{T} \right).
\end{equation}

If the processing time of the recieved signals is given by $T_p$, then, after processing, the distance of the car to the wall is calculated by

\begin{equation}
	x_{car} = d-(T_s +T_p) v'.
\end{equation}

Substituting Equations \ref{eq:ass-2-vel-car} and \ref{eq:ass-2-pre-dist-car} yields an expression for the actual distance of the car to the non-moving object. This expression is given by

\begin{equation}
	x_{car} = \frac{v}{4 T} \left((T'+T) T_s + 2 T_p (T'-T)  \right).
\end{equation}

The linearized relative uncertainty, given by

\begin{equation}
	u_{d,rel} = \frac{1}{x_{car}} \left( \frac{d x_{car}}{d T} \Delta T + \frac{d x_{car}}{d T'} \Delta T' + \frac{d x_{car}}{d T_p} \Delta T_p + \frac{d x_{car}}{d T_s} \Delta T_s \right),
\end{equation}

yields

\begin{equation}
	u_{d,rel} = \frac{
		-T(T_s + 2 T_p) u_T + T^2 (u_{T_s} - 2 u_{T_p}) + T \left( (T_s + 2 T_p) u_{T'} + T' (u_{T_s} + 2 u_{T_p}) \right)
	}{
		T \left( (T'+T)T_s + 2 T_p (T'-T) \right)
	}.
\end{equation}

If one can assume that

\begin{equation}
	\frac{u_T}{T} = \frac{u_{T'}}{T'} = \frac{u_{T_p}}{T_p} = \frac{u_{T_s}}{T_s}=r,
\end{equation}

then the linearized relative uncertainty $u_{d,rel}$ magically simplifies to $r$. \textit{Mathematica 9 Student Edition} was used for aid in algebraic manipulation and simplification of the equations. Unfortunately, signal processing of ultrasonic sensors is handled by KITT.
