In this task the influence of noise on the bit error rate will be analyzed. First the optimal decision threshold was determined. This was done by keeping the noise standard deviation on \num{0.05} and measuring the bit error rate for different threshold values. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:app-th} in Appendix~\ref{app:res}. The results show that the optimal decision threshold is given by \num{0.02}. Note that this experiment was done at home.

The influence of the noise on the bit error rate will now be investigated. This is done by keeping the decision threshold constant and increasing the noise standard deviation by \num{0.1}. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:app-noise} in Appendix~\ref{app:res}. The results make clear that increasing the noise increases the BER. This is according to our calculations in Appendix~\ref{app:sig-an}.
