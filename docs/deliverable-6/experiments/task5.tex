Appendix \ref{app:sig-res} shows that an FSK signal's signal-to-noise ratio for high data rates is better than that of an ASK signal and that FSK is less sensitive to noise. Therefore, we expected that FSK with a high carrier frequency in combination with a frequency devation large enough to achieve the desired BER would yield us the best performance.
