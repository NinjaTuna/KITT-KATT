Appendix \ref{app:sig-an} shows that an FSK signal's signal-to-noise ratio for high data rates is better than that of an ASK signal. Also, it shows that an FSK signal is likely less sensitive to noise than an ASK signal. Therefore, we expected that FSK in combination with a frequency deviation large enough to achieve the desired BER would yield us the best performance. Furthermore, as we expect to achieve the desired BER, we reckon that a ECC would not be optimal, as it decreases the information rate a lot. The results and settings used for our best achieved BER for a maximal information rate are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:app-ber} in Appendix~\ref{app:res}.
