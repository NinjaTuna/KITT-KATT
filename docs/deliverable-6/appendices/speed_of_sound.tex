\chapter{Speed of sound}
Let us derive an expression for the speed of sound with herein the dependency on environment temperature and humidity. From the Newton-Laplace equation for the speed of sound in a medium

\begin{equation}
	c = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}},
\end{equation}

where $K$ is a coefficient of stiffness (the bulk modulus) and $\rho$ the density of the medium in conjunction with the fact that for a gas holds that

\begin{equation}
	K = \gamma p,
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ denotes the \emph{adiabatic index} of the gas and $p$ its pressure, yields the following expression:

\begin{equation}
	c = \sqrt{\gamma \frac{p}{\rho}}.
\end{equation}

Assuming $\gamma$ and $p$ are known, we now need to find an expression for the density of the water-air mixture, $\rho$.
To accomplish this, we utilize the ideal gas law

\begin{equation}
	p V = n R T,
\end{equation}

with $V$ the gas volume, $n$ the number of molecules, $R$ the specific gas constant and $T$ the absolute temperature in Kelvin, together with the definition of density $\rho = n / V$ to obtain:

\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{p}{R T}.
\end{equation}

Now, since the density of a mixture can be written as the sum of the densities of the individual gases, we can write:

\begin{equation}
	\rho_{air} = \frac{p_a}{R_a T} + \frac{p_w}{R_w T},
\end{equation}

where $p_a$, $R_a$, $p_w$ and $R_w$ are the pressures and specific gas constants for dry air and water vapor respectively.

% TODO
% Express air density in terms of total air pressure and relative humidity level in %
% Give an expression / derive a value for gamma (see wikipedia - relative humidity or ww2010....)
% Perform calculation for typical environment
